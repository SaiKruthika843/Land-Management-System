## PoET Algorithm
<br/>
Proof of elapsed time (PoET) is a consensus algorithm developed by Intel Corporation that enables permissioned blockchain networks to determine who creates the next block.
<br/>
PoET follows a lottery system that spreads the chances of winning equally across network participants, giving every node the same chance.
<br/>
The PoET algorithm generates a random wait time for each node in the blockchain network; each node must sleep for that duration.
<br/>
The node with the shortest wait time will wake up first and win the block, thus being allowed to commit a new block to the blockchain.
<br/>
The PoET workflow is similar to Bitcoin's proof of work (PoW) but consumes less power because it allows a node to sleep and switch to other tasks for the specified time, thereby increasing network energy efficiency.
<br/>
Proof of elapsed time uses much less energy than proof of work since it randomly selects a node instead of using all the miners on a network in a competition.
